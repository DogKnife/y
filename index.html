        <h1>Earth</h1>
        Earth as a whole would probobly start to look like a sphere of brown(dirt), blue(water), and grey(rocks) and would probobly look like mars with water and a lot of CO2 gas

        <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
        The atmosphere would most likely become filled with CO2 as there are no trees to absord the carbon and it would mostly look like a foggy wasteland

        <h1>Hydrosphere</h1>
        It is debatable weather the water on earth would all boil or not due to hotter tempatures in the atmosphere but it is likely so

        <h1>Geosphere</h1>
        The only thing that could happen is most rocks melt due to higher tempatures but thats mainly it
